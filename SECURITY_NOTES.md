# Security Notes

## CodeQL Analysis Results

### Rate Limiting Recommendation

**Finding**: The newly added `/user/info/:userId` endpoint (and other existing routes) are not rate-limited.

**Severity**: Low to Medium
**Status**: Documented (Not Fixed)

**Rationale for Not Fixing**:
- This is a general security recommendation that applies to ALL API endpoints, not just the newly added one
- The entire API lacks rate limiting - it's a architectural decision, not specific to this change
- Fixing this would require adding rate limiting middleware to all routes, which goes beyond the scope of minimal changes to sync frontend-backend
- The existing routes (login, signup, feed, connections, etc.) also lack rate limiting

**Recommendation for Future**:
Consider adding rate limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) to all API endpoints:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(limiter);
```

## Other Security Measures Already in Place

✅ **Authentication**: JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies (protected from XSS)
✅ **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
✅ **CORS**: Restricted to specific frontend origin
✅ **Credentials**: Environment variables in .gitignore
✅ **Input Validation**: Request validation in place for signup and profile edit
✅ **Authorization**: userAuth middleware checks authentication before protected routes

## No New Vulnerabilities Introduced

The changes made for frontend-backend synchronization:
- Updated port configuration (no security impact)
- Added missing API endpoint with existing security middleware
- Fixed response formats (no security impact)
- Added field to populate query (no security impact)
- Improved error logging (positive security impact)

All new code follows the existing security patterns in the codebase.
