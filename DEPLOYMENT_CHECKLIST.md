- Recommended for production

## Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment
1. Clone repository on server
2. `cd backend && npm install`
3. Create production `.env` file with real credentials
4. Start with `npm start` or use process manager (PM2)
5. Verify database connection
6. Configure reverse proxy (nginx) if needed

### Frontend Deployment
1. Update production API URL if needed
2. `npm run build`
3. Deploy `dist/` folder to web server
4. Configure server to serve index.html for all routes (SPA)
5. Verify CORS settings match frontend domain

### Post-Deployment Verification
1. Test user registration and login
2. Test all critical user flows
3. Monitor error logs
4. Check database for proper data storage
5. Verify payments work end-to-end
6. Test WebSocket connections

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Keep previous version running on separate port
2. Switch traffic back to previous version
3. Debug issues in staging environment
4. Re-deploy when fixed

## Success Criteria

## Additional Notes

The DevConnect application's frontend-backend integration has been thoroughly reviewed and documented. All API endpoints are correctly configured, authentication is properly implemented, and error handling is consistent throughout the application.

Previous integration work resolved all critical synchronization issues:
- Port configuration corrected
- Missing API endpoints added
- Response formats standardized
- CORS properly configured
- Socket.io integration working

This deployment checklist ensures all requirements are met before going to production.
